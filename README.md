CreativeCoding
==============

Professional Development for Creative Coders that want to use programming as their brush, taught with Cinder and C++. However, many of the concepts apply to all programming languages and all frameworks.

Code will be in the repo and links to videos can be found in the readme's. Clone this repo into your cinder/blocks folder.
